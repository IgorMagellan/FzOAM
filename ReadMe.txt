INSTALLATION & USAGE
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

OruxMaps:
---------

Manual install:
- Please make sure you downloaded "FzOAM.zip"
- If it's an update of existing FzOAM map themes: remove all old files and folders
- Unzip FzOAM.zip with an Android file explorer to "../oruxmaps/mapstyles/" on your SD-Card or internal memory (depending on your device)
- You can choose your own path for theme files in OruxMaps via "...", "Global settings", "Maps", "Mapsforge settings" and "Mapsforge themes"

Choose map style:
- Make sure in OruxMaps settings that "User interface", "Miscellaneous UI", "No Navigation Drawer" is not checked
- Open navigation drawer by swiping from the left border, tap on "Mapsforge theme", tap on the the theme you like to use (FzOAM)
- Use the cog wheel next to "Mapsforge theme" in the navigation drawer to choose the map style (hiking, cycling, city, mountainbike) and (de-)select overlays
- There are other ways like the old style action bar or on screen buttons, use the OruxMaps manual on how to use this


Locus:
------

Manual install:
- Please make sure you downloaded "FzOAM.zip"
- If it's an update of existing FzOAM map theme files: remove all old files and folders
- Unzip FzOAM.zip with an Android file explorer into a subfolder of "../Locus/mapsVector/_themes/" on your SD-Card or internal memory (depending on your device)

Choose map style:
- For choosing the map theme in Locus use the blue button on the bottom left side of the map for "Map content" and press "Map themes" (if not available open settings, "Maps", "Panels & Buttons", "Left Actions Panel", check "Map content") 
- Touch the name of the map theme (if necessary hit "Show more" below "Internal themes")
- For choosing map styles (hiking, cycling, city, mountainbike) and overlays, a menu pops up when choosing the map theme. To change again later, just use "Map themes" again.
- There are other ways to do this, use the Locus manual for reference

This means you can use it in a commercial app etc. for free if you:
- attribute the origin (for example: "uses Elevate map theme by Tobias Kühn, http://www.openandromaps.org/en/legend/elevate-mountain-hike-theme")
- don't change anything or use parts of it, so you can only use it if you include the whole contents of the zip file

For non-commercial usage you are free to reuse everything I made if you stick to those conditions:
- attribute the origin (for example: "symbols/patterns/code based on Elevate theme by Tobias Kühn, http://www.openandromaps.org/en/legend/elevate-mountain-hike-theme")
- don't use it for commercial purposes, that means for example you are not allowed to include (also parts) or directly download with a commercial app; if in doubt contact me
- if you use some of my work it has to be under the same license
- have a look at the licenses of the resources I used below, those can differ - please also stick to those

I'm always happy to hear someone can use my work, so it would be nice if you contact me to let me know
