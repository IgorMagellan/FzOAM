>Hello, fellow walkers, runners, bikers, hikers and mountaineers!
>
>While searching for the best map and theme source I've found two great projects:
>1. OpenAndroMaps is already a huge one, with well tuned maps and many themes (Thank You!).
>Unfortunately in my opinion, none of them was easy to read and/or detailed enough.
>2. Freizeitkarte on the other hand isn't that widespread, but is an impressive project (Thank You!).
>It is far more detailed and has really good themes.
>The only major flaw was that the theme details appear too late when zooming.
> 
> I wasn't brave enough to tune the zoom level for every detail,
> but tried adding the useful landscape details to the feature rich Elements theme for OAM.
> Most of the textures are directly borrowed or heavily inspired of FZK.
> The documents and key file are slightly tuned accordingly.
> I am providing the result if anyone finds it useful.
> I don't have the time and talent to support and develop the new theme.
> If someone decides to adopt it, I will be very happy!
> Until then I hope You enjoy it.
> 
> Happy journeying everyone!
